Thanks for visiting my page! I am a PhD candidate at the Energy Market and Analytics section at DTU Wind, supervised by Prof. [Lesia Mitridati](https://sites.google.com/view/lesiamitridati/) and Prof. [Spyros Chatzivasileiadis](http://chatziva.com/)

I have summarized my research interests below:
* Future energy market design - local markets for prosumers/energy communities
* Optimal decision-making in power markets under uncertainty

I am exploring tools from Optimization, Game Theory, and Machine Learning to look at the above problems. I completed my Master of Science in Robotics, Systems, and Control from ETH Z&uuml;rich in 2024, and Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD) in 2021.

Have something to discuss, feel free to reach out!
